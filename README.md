# `gdpkg` : `g = gui dpkg`
It's literally a automation script opening dpkg in a new console window for you.
## Why?
Tbh, I just like running dpkg in console rather than using the default Software Installer that comes with Ubuntu Linux.
## How to install?
```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheHackerCoding/gdpkg.git
cd gdpkg
chmod +x installer
./installer
```
## What do I need?
```
dpkg "ofc"
gnome-terminal "might change that later"
tee "should be in every linux os"
```
## Other info
Based on the `.desktop` file, it should work when browsers download a `.deb`
